# ds_bootcamp_module11
Jiahui's homework for Module 11

part_1_mars_news.ipynb is for Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News.

part_2_mars_weather_method1.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather_method2.ipynb is for Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data.

In *method1.ipynb, a Pandas DataFrame was created first. Then the data was found and saved to that DataFrame.

In *method2.ipynb, I strictly follow the process in the starter file.

mars_weather.csv is the CSV file for exporting the data frame.
